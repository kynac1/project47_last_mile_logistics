# Project #47: Dealing with uncertainty in last-mile logistics

## Description:

In the past 10-years e-commerce has expanded rapidly, leading to tremedous increases in goods being delivered directly to consumers' homes. This growth in demand is expected to accelerate over the next decade, so it is crucial that planning and logistics systems are developed to manage this increased demand.

In this project we will consider how different forms of uncertainty influences performance for delivery companies, and develop methods to handle this uncertainty.

## Outcome:

- Data analysis of previous order data and Census data to project future demand, by area.

- Implementation of Vehicle Routing Problem with time windows, modelling travel time and fuel usage.

- Approximate dynamic programming methods to find optimal delivery schedules.

- A simulation tool to evaluate performance of schedules.
